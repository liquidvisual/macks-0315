## Macks Advisory helps companies unlock value in insolvent or near-insolvent situations

Macks Advisory is a boutique advisory firm specialising in Corporate Advisory, Restructure & Turnaround and both Corporate & Personal Insolvency.

Our focus is on dealing with companies and individuals in financial stress, turning them around where possible and working closely with stakeholders to maximise returns or minimise losses.

We develop strategies in insolvent or near insolvent situations that, when implemented with precision, will maximise returns for stakeholders.

We are well connected with industry specialists and the combined experience from our team of Official Liquidators and Trustees in Bankruptcy is over 70 years.  This valuable experience enables us to marshal appropriate resources and expertise to deliver timely and cost effective results in all situations.
